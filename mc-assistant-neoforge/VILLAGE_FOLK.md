# Village Folk

A settlement that runs itself. Nobody hires them, points them at ground, or gives
them a trade: they choose a trade the village is short of, stake ground for it,
work it, stash what they make, eat, sleep, build the village up and — if they are
fed and in work — raise children.

Everything is obtainable in **survival**.

## Getting a village

| How | What you do |
|---|---|
| **Village Folk Spawner** (recommended) | Craft it — 8 bread round a gold ingot — and *place* it. The first one founds a village on the spot and leaves the founding stores in a chest where it stood; each one placed after that, within reach, adds a settler. |
| **Village Charter** | Right-click the ground. Same result as the spawner; craftable with paper, bread, a gold ingot, seeds and a chest. |
| **/village spawn [1-100]** | Stands folk up two blocks ahead of you. `spawnat <x> <z> [n]` for the console. |
| **The world** | Villages generate as you explore (config `naturalVillages`), in groups of three to five. |
| **Vanilla villagers** | Turned into folk as you meet them (config `replaceVillagers`). Trading with them stops working; wandering traders are untouched. |

## What they do

* **Trades** — at ten folk: four farmers, three miners, two woodcutters, one
  smelter. More trades open as the village grows: a watch, a carrier, a
  storekeeper, a rancher, a fisher.
* **Ground** — each trade claims its own plot (farms by water, woods, hillsides
  to dig) and works it. Plots are never shared.
* **Stores** — every chest and furnace a folk puts down is named **Village
  Store**. Folk use *only* containers with that name, so a village founded next
  to your base leaves your chests alone. To let them use a chest of yours,
  rename it *Village Store* in an anvil. A sign on a chest still hides it from
  everybody.
* **Food** — wheat is baked into bread by whoever is idle (including everybody
  at dusk, indoors). A folk short of rations fetches some from the stores. A
  folk eats one ration every four and a half minutes of work. Every folk is sent
  out with carrots and potatoes as well as wheat seed, and any settler may sow
  them: a root plant gives three or so to eat and each of those is a plant
  again, where a wheat plant gives one ear.
* **Building** — one project at a time, one lead builder per project, on a lot
  chosen once on the village's own grid: storage, shelter, houses, then (as the
  village comes of age) a wall, a smeltery, a workshop, a watchtower, a
  lighthouse. A lot is dry, within twelve blocks of the ground at the heart and
  no steeper than four blocks across; the builder fills the low side up to the
  floor and fells any tree in the way (keeping the wood). If the builders cannot
  get to a lot (three cells in a row out of reach and nothing standing) it is
  given up and another is chosen; a village that has been all round its lots
  without a find is less particular the next time. Stone is spent before planks,
  and planks before logs. For its
  first ten minutes a village keeps the founding planks, stone and chests for
  its storehouse.
* **Evenings** — at home for the night a folk takes on rations from the stores;
  two folk who are home and fed can raise a child (so a village that starts from
  two spawner items can grow).
* **Breaks** — one a day, at an hour of each folk's own.
* **Pace** — a folk works a little over twice as fast as a hired assistant and
  wears a tool a third as fast: a village that dug a block every five seconds
  raised one building a game day.
* **Days** — the day shift works the day, then goes home; the watch keeps the
  night. Nobody builds, mines or moves house after dark. Sleeping in a bed skips
  the night for everybody, wherever you are.
* **Ages** — Wood → Stone → Iron → Diamond → Nether, each with its own list of
  what the village needs. A village that reaches a new age says so, once, in
  chat. Folk themselves never speak.
* **Growth** — two folk who are fed and in work, standing together, have a
  chance of raising a child, paced across the whole village. Cap: 100 by
  default, 500 at most (`villageGrowthCap`).

Right-click a folk to see what it carries and what it is doing. You can look;
only its owner (nobody, for folk) can rearrange the pack.

## Commands

* `/village list` — every village the game knows of: where, how many live
  there, what age, what has been built. Works from the console.
* `/village status` — age, headcount, trades, what the stores hold, what has
  been built, what the village is short of. Works from the console.
* `/village folk` — one line per folk: trade, ground, status, job, what is
  missing, what it carries (`pack=`), what it last tried at the essentials
  gate (`gate=`), and a trail of the jobs it has run.

## Config (`config/mc_assistant-common.toml`, section `[villages]`)

`naturalVillages`, `villageSpacing`, `villageMinFolk`, `villageMaxFolk`,
`villageBreeding`, `villageGrowthCap`, `villageLoadedChunks`, `replaceVillagers`,
`protectTradedVillagers`.

## How this is tested

Compiling proves nothing about a system this large, so the village is *run*.
Every push to CI:

* boots a real headless server and runs the game tests in
  `src/gametest/java` — recipes load, the spawner block, the charter and the
  commands work, a vanilla villager is swapped for a folk, and twelve folk are
  left alone for **three game days** on ground of the test's own making;
* starts a real dedicated server with vanilla world generation, settles a
  village in a chosen biome over RCON (`tools/realworld/soak.py`), lets three
  game days pass at full speed, puts a raid of zombies, skeletons, creepers and
  spiders among the settlers at dusk, and reports — for plains, forest, taiga
  and savanna;
* settles a hundred folk on one map and reports what that costs a tick;
* checks a generated vanilla village's villagers are converted without
  freezing the server;
* builds a storehouse on a hillside and among trees (game tests `t11`, `t12`),
  so the ground work — filling the low side, felling the tree in the way — runs;
* runs ten game days in a forest, to see whether a village grows up (ages,
  houses, births) or only gets through three days;
* runs a real game client on a virtual display (software OpenGL), has it join a
  server, stands a village and some armoured folk in front of it and publishes
  screenshots (`smoke-*.png`) and the client's log, because nothing else in CI
  ever draws a folk;
* lets a world found villages as ground generates, the way exploring does;
* founds a village, saves and stops the server, starts the same world again,
  and checks the village came back and carries on.

Every folk's tick and every village event handler runs inside a guard
(`[MCA-GUARD]` in the log): a bug in a folk's thinking is written down and that one
folk misses a beat, rather than the exception stopping the server.

A watcher thread in the mod writes the server thread's stack to the log
whenever a tick takes longer than a second and a half (`MCA-STALL`), so a freeze
can be traced to the call that caused it. The reports print those stacks, the
chunk queue (`MCA-CHUNKS`), and why a village was or was not building
(`MCA-BUILD`).

The reports are published to the `village-test-latest` release: `vt-report.txt`,
`real-<scenario>.txt` and `smoke.txt` with its pictures. Each dashboard line says what one folk is doing and
why it is not doing more.
