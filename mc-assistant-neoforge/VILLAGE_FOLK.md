# Village Folk

A settlement that runs itself. Nobody hires them, points them at ground, or gives
them a trade: they choose a trade the village is short of, stake ground for it,
work it, stash what they make, eat, sleep, build the village up and — if they are
fed and in work — raise children.

Everything is obtainable in **survival**.

## Getting a village

| How | What you do |
|---|---|
| **Village Folk Spawner** (recommended) | Craft it — 8 bread round a gold ingot — and *place* it. The first one founds a village of eight on the spot (the same start a village the world grows gets) and leaves the founding stores in a chest where it stood; each one placed after that, within reach, adds one settler. That is the last thing a village needs from you. |
| **Village Charter** | Right-click the ground. Same result as the spawner; craftable with paper, bread, a gold ingot, seeds and a chest. |
| **/village spawn [1-100]** | Stands folk up two blocks ahead of you. `spawnat <x> <z> [n]` for the console. |
| **The world** | Villages generate as you explore (config `naturalVillages`), in groups of three to five. |
| **Vanilla villagers** | Turned into folk as you meet them (config `replaceVillagers`). Trading with them stops working; wandering traders are untouched. |

## From the first spawner to the Nether Age

Place a spawner and walk away. Nothing below needs you: no commands, no orders, no
chests to fill, no player nearby (a village keeps its own ground loaded, and the
real-terrain tests run on a server with nobody on it). Everything happens on its
own, and each step is there for a reason the village can see.

1. **Founding.** Eight folk stand up where the spawner stood and found the village,
   with a chest of founding stores: bread, seed, carrots and potatoes, saplings, torches,
   planks, cobblestone, four chests, string. Every folk carries rations, stone tools,
   a bench and a chest of its own.
2. **Trades and ground.** Each takes the trade the village is shortest of (farmers
   first, then miners, woodcutters, a smelter; a watch, a carrier, a storekeeper, a
   rancher and a fisher as it grows), stakes ground that suits it, sets its chest down
   and works.
3. **The storehouse, first.** For its first half hour the founding planks, stone and
   chests are kept for it. It goes up within minutes: four chests under one roof.
4. **A shelter, then houses.** *Why:* a village has room for twelve, and every house
   is room for five more (a shelter three, the meeting hall six). Two fed folk in
   work raise a child only while there is room **and** the stores hold a day's
   meals for everybody, so the village builds a house whenever it is nearly full
   and farms ahead of its mouths. That loop (food put by → children → hands →
   materials → houses → room → children) is what makes it grow, and because
   children come out of a surplus, the larder each age asks for is there too.
5. **A well** at the middle marks the camp as a village, and the Wood Age asks for it
   with timber, food in the stores, the storehouse, the shelter and enough houses.
6. **The Stone Age:** quarry stone and coal, a **wall** round the village (it follows
   the ground and goes round the houses, fields and ponds already there), more
   houses, a **smeltery** of three furnaces, and a **meeting hall**. The miners take
   their mines down to the iron seam (height 16, where this game puts the most
   iron) to be ready for the next age.
7. **The Iron Age:** iron for the watch's armour and everybody's tools — each miner
   has an iron pickaxe made from the stores — a **workshop**, a **watchtower** and a
   **market**.
8. **The Diamond Age:** every other miner with an iron pickaxe goes down to the
   diamonds near the bottom of the world; twice the Iron Age's iron, a
   **lighthouse** and a **chapel**.
9. **The Nether Age:** a diamond pickaxe for the miners, obsidian, and an obsidian
   **gateway** (never lit).
10. **And then it never stops.** A village that has come through every age raises
    **great works** — a granary, barracks, a monument, round and round, each on new
    ground — and every one asks the stores for a quarter more food, stone and iron
    than the last. `/village status` shows its **renown** (great works raised).
11. **Colonies.** From the Stone Age on, a village of forty sends a founding party of
    eight a couple of hundred blocks out, fed from its own larder, and they found a
    village of their own that climbs the ages from the start — at most one every two
    game days from any one village, and never past the folk the whole world may
    hold (`villageWorldCap`). Over a long game the settlements spread across the map.

A project that cannot go ahead — no ground for it, the stores cannot pay for it yet,
or a part nobody can make yet (obsidian) — is set aside for a few minutes and the
next thing on the list goes up meanwhile, so one stuck building never holds up an
age.

Each age is announced once in chat (the only thing a village ever says).
`/village status` shows what it is short of, how much room it has, whether it is
growing (and if not, what it is waiting for), and what it will build next and why.

### The buildings

| Building | Footprint | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| Storehouse | 5×5 | Walls, a raised roof, four chests inside |
| Shelter | 5×5 | Walls and a raised roof: somewhere out of the night |
| House | 5×5 | Floor, walls four high with windows and a doorway, stepped roof; bench, furnace, chest, light, two beds when there is wool |
| Well | 3×3 | Stone curb, four fence posts, a roof and a light |
| Wall | ring of 27 | Three high above the ground wherever the ground is, a gate on one side, lit corners |
| Smeltery | 5×5 | Three furnaces, two chests, a bench |
| Meeting hall | 7×7 | Walls four high with windows all round, stepped roof, two chests, a bench, light |
| Workshop | 5×5 | Bench, furnace, chest |
| Watchtower | 3×3 | A lookout platform up a ladder |
| Lighthouse | 3×3 | Twelve high, ladder inside, lit crown |
| Pen | 7×7 | Fence ring with a gate, once there is a rancher |
| Market | 7×7 | A roof on eight fence posts over two chests, two benches and a furnace (Iron Age) |
| Chapel | 5×7 | Walls four high with tall windows, a ridged roof, a lit altar (Diamond Age) |
| Gateway | 4×5 | An obsidian portal frame with stone corners, never lit (Nether Age) |
| Granary | 5×5 | Corners cut away, slit windows, stepped roof, three chests (great work) |
| Barracks | 7×7 | Bunks, chests and a bench; room for six (great work) |
| Monument | 3×3 | Plinth, step, pillar and a light (great work) |

Builders pick the flattest nearby lot that costs least, level it (filling the low
side, felling any tree in the way and keeping the wood), and build from what they
actually carry: stone before planks, planks before logs.

## What they do

* **Trades** — at ten folk: four farmers, three miners, two woodcutters, one
  smelter. More trades open as the village grows: a watch, a carrier, a
  storekeeper, a rancher, a fisher.
* **Ground** — each trade claims its own plot (farms by water, woods, hillsides
  to dig) and works it. Plots are never shared.
* **Stores** — every chest and furnace a folk puts down is named **Village
  Store**. Folk use *only* containers with that name, so a village founded next
  to your base leaves your chests alone. To let them use a chest of yours,
  rename it *Village Store* in an anvil. A sign on a chest still hides it from
  everybody.
* **Food** — wheat is baked into bread by whoever is idle (including everybody
  at dusk, indoors). A folk short of rations fetches some from the stores. A
  folk eats one ration every four and a half minutes of work. Every folk is sent
  out with carrots and potatoes as well as wheat seed, and any settler may sow
  them: a root plant gives three or so to eat and each of those is a plant
  again, where a wheat plant gives one ear.
* **Building** — one project at a time, one lead builder per project, on a lot
  chosen once on the village's own grid: storage, shelter, houses, a well, then
  (as the village comes of age) a wall, a smeltery, a meeting hall, a workshop, a
  watchtower, a market, a lighthouse, a chapel, a gateway, and after that the great
  works for ever. A lot is dry, within twelve blocks of the ground at the heart and
  no steeper than four blocks across; the builder fills the low side up to the
  floor and fells any tree in the way (keeping the wood). If the builders cannot
  get to a lot (three cells in a row out of reach and nothing standing) it is
  given up and another is chosen, and the builder puts everything it drew for it
  back in the stores for whoever raises it; a village that has been all round
  its lots without a find is less particular the next time. Stone is spent before planks,
  and planks before logs. For its
  first ten minutes a village keeps the founding planks, stone and chests for
  its storehouse.
* **Evenings** — at home for the night a folk takes on rations from the stores;
  two folk who are home and fed can raise a child (so a village that starts from
  two spawner items can grow).
* **Breaks** — one a day, at an hour of each folk's own.
* **Pace** — a folk works a little over twice as fast as a hired assistant and
  wears a tool a third as fast: a village that dug a block every five seconds
  raised one building a game day.
* **Days** — the day shift works the day, then goes home; the watch keeps the
  night. Nobody builds, mines or moves house after dark. Sleeping in a bed skips
  the night for everybody, wherever you are.
* **Ages** — Wood → Stone → Iron → Diamond → Nether, each with its own list of
  what the village needs, then great works with no end. A village that reaches a new age says so, once, in
  chat. Folk themselves never speak.
* **Growth** — two folk who are fed and in work, standing together, have a
  chance of raising a child, paced across the whole village, while there is room
  and the stores hold a day's meals for everybody. Cap: 100 by
  default, 500 at most (`villageGrowthCap`).

Right-click a folk to see what it carries and what it is doing. You can look;
only its owner (nobody, for folk) can rearrange the pack.

## Commands

* `/village list` — every village the game knows of: where, how many live
  there, what age, what has been built. Works from the console.
* `/village status` — age, headcount, trades, what the stores hold, what has
  been built, what the village is short of. Works from the console.
* `/village folk` — one line per folk: trade, ground, status, job, what is
  missing, what it carries (`pack=`), what it last tried at the essentials
  gate (`gate=`), and a trail of the jobs it has run.

## Config (`config/mc_assistant-common.toml`, section `[villages]`)

## How this is tested

Compiling proves nothing about a system this large, so the village is *run*.
Every push to CI:

* boots a real headless server and runs the game tests in
  `src/gametest/java` — recipes load, the spawner block, the charter and the
  commands work, a vanilla villager is swapped for a folk, and twelve folk are
  left alone for **three game days** on ground of the test's own making;
* starts a real dedicated server with vanilla world generation, settles a
  village in a chosen biome over RCON (`tools/realworld/soak.py`), lets three
  game days pass at full speed, puts a raid of zombies, skeletons, creepers and
  spiders among the settlers at dusk, and reports — for plains, forest, taiga
  and savanna;
* settles a hundred folk on one map and reports what that costs a tick;
* checks a generated vanilla village's villagers are converted without
  freezing the server;
* builds a storehouse on a hillside and among trees (game tests `t11`, `t12`),
  so the ground work — filling the low side, felling the tree in the way — runs;
* plays **the long game** in a workflow of its own that a push never cancels
  (`village-long-soak.yml`): one village founded the way a spawner founds one, left
  alone for up to sixty game days, with a line a day saying how many folk, which
  age, how many buildings, its renown and how many villages the world now holds —
  published every ten minutes while it runs (`real-epic.txt`);
* raises the later ages' buildings and a great work for real (game test `t14`), and
  checks the order a village builds in all the way past the last age, and that a
  grown village founds a colony (`t15`, `t16`);
* runs a real game client on a virtual display (software OpenGL), has it join a
  server, stands a village and some armoured folk in front of it and publishes
  screenshots (`smoke-*.png`) and the client's log, because nothing else in CI
  ever draws a folk;
* lets a world found villages as ground generates, the way exploring does;
* founds a village, saves and stops the server, starts the same world again,
  and checks the village came back and carries on.

Every folk's tick and every village event handler runs inside a guard
(`[MCA-GUARD]` in the log): a bug in a folk's thinking is written down and that one
folk misses a beat, rather than the exception stopping the server.

A watcher thread in the mod writes the server thread's stack to the log
whenever a tick takes longer than a second and a half (`MCA-STALL`), so a freeze
can be traced to the call that caused it. The reports print those stacks, the
chunk queue (`MCA-CHUNKS`), and why a village was or was not building
(`MCA-BUILD`).

The reports are published to the `village-test-latest` release: `vt-report.txt`,
`real-<scenario>.txt` and `smoke.txt` with its pictures. Each dashboard line says what one folk is doing and
why it is not doing more.
